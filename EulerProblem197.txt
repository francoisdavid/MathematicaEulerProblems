Euler Problem # 197 -- >Investigating the behaviour of a recursively defined sequence
Given is the function f(x) = \[LeftFloor]2^30.403243784-x2\[RightFloor] * 10-9 ( \[LeftFloor] \[RightFloor] is the floor-function),
the sequence un is defined by u0 = -1 and un+1 = f(un).

Find un + un+1 for n = 1012.
Give your answer with 9 digits after the decimal point.
